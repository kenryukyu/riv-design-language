# Basic Variables

## Naming Rules

Variables names are pre-defined but they follow a basic naming convention.

&lt;variable-name&gt;-&lt;size&gt;

## Default Size

The default size is usually specified as **medium \(md\)**, or **base**.

## Common Sizes

There usually are three common sizes, **medium \(md\), large \(lg\), and small \(sm\).**

## Other Sizes

If bigger or smaller sizes are needed use x, 2x, 3x, 4x, etc....

For example:

\(small\) sm, xs, 2xs, 3xs, .......

\(large\) lg, 2xl, 3xs, ......
